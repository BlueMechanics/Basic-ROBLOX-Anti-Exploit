# Basic-ROBLOX-Anti-Exploit
A basic anti-exploit I created on ROLBOX Studio

The code requires a RemoteEvent in ReplicatedStorage, but you don't have to worry about that since the code sets it up itself.
It's quite simple to set up however;
1. Put the "Client" file in StarterPlayer --> StarterPlayerScripts (once you have your ROBLOX Studio game/file opened)
2. Put both "Server_BandHandler" & "Server_Webhook" in ServerScriptService
3. Open "Server_Webhook" and change the webhook URL to your liking.
4. That's it!
